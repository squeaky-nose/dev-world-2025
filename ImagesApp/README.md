#  ImagesApp

This repo contains sample code for my `BUILDING APPS THAT SCALE WITHOUT LOSING YOUR MOTIVATION` talk at [/dev/world 2025](https://devworld.au/).

In order to run this application you will need to fill in the OpenAI and Pexels API Keys. 

## OpenAI
Plist File: `ImagesApp/Utils/ImageAnalysis/OpenAI/OpenAI.plist`

Go to platform.openai.com, sign in, then open View API Keys under your account settings. Click Create new secret key and copy it — that’s your OpenAI API key.

## OpenAI
Plist File: `ImagesApp/Utils/ImageLoader/Pexels/API/PexelsAPI.plist`

1. Go to pexels.com/api.
2. Sign up or log in with your Pexels account.
3. Click Get Started → you’ll see your API Key on the dashboard.
