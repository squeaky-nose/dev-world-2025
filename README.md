# /dev/world 2025

This repo contains sample code for my `BUILDING APPS THAT SCALE WITHOUT LOSING YOUR MOTIVATION` talk at [/dev/world 2025](https://devworld.au/)

The 3 sub-projects in this repo are:

1. Coordinator. Sample project that uses a coordinator design pattern in SwiftUI.
2. DependencyInjection. Sample project that introduces a reusable dependency injection pattern.
3. ImagesApp. Sample multi screen app that combines the Coordinator and DependencyInjection. Demonstrates how these can be used for top-down mobile application development.
